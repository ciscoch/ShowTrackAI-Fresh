## üìö FFA SAE Context & Educational Alignment

### **Supervised Agricultural Experience (SAE) Program**

SAE projects are a required component of agricultural education that provide students with:
- **Hands-on Learning**: Real-world agricultural experience
- **Financial Literacy**: Record keeping and business management skills
- **Career Preparation**: Industry-relevant knowledge and skills
- **Leadership Development**: Project planning and execution

### **Break-Even Analysis in Agricultural Education**

Break-even analysis is a fundamental concept in FFA curricula that teaches students:
- **Cost Management**: Understanding fixed and variable costs
- **Revenue Projections**: Market analysis and price forecasting
- **Risk Assessment**: Financial planning and contingency management
- **Profit Maximization**: Strategies for improving project profitability

---

## üí∞ Financial Components & Calculations

### **Key Financial Metrics**

1. **Acquisition Cost**: Initial investment in livestock
2. **Variable Costs**: Feed, veterinary care, supplies, transportation
3. **Fixed Costs**: Facilities, equipment, insurance
4. **Predicted Sale Value**: Market research-based revenue projection
5. **Break-Even Point**: Minimum sale price to cover all costs

### **Break-Even Formula**
```
Break-Even Point = Total Costs (Acquisition + Variable + Fixed)
Profit = Predicted Sale Value - Total Costs
ROI = (Profit / Total Investment) √ó 100
```

### **Example Market Steer Project**
```
Initial Investment:
‚Ä¢ Purchase Price: $800
‚Ä¢ Equipment & Setup: $200
‚Ä¢ Total Initial: $1,000

Variable Costs (6 months):
‚Ä¢ Feed: $400
‚Ä¢ Veterinary: $75
‚Ä¢ Show Expenses: $150
‚Ä¢ Total Variable: $625

Total Project Costs: $1,625
Predicted Sale Value: $1,800
Expected Profit: $175
ROI: 10.8%
Break-Even Point: $1,625
```
