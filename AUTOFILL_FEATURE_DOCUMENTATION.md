# ü§ñ AI Autofill Feature Documentation
## ShowTrackAI - Intelligent Journal Entry Generation

---

## üéØ **Feature Overview**

The AI Autofill feature is an intelligent content generation system that automatically creates professional journal entry titles and descriptions based on user input context. This feature leverages advanced contextual analysis to generate high-quality, detailed entries that align with agricultural education standards and livestock management best practices.

---

## ‚ö° **Core Functionality**

### **Smart Context Analysis**
The system analyzes multiple data points to generate intelligent suggestions:
- **Feed Data**: Types, brands, amounts, costs of feeds used
- **AET Categories**: Selected Agricultural Education & Training skills
- **Learning Objectives**: Chosen educational goals
- **Location & Weather**: Environmental context and conditions  
- **Time Context**: Time of day, date, season, day of week
- **Duration**: Activity length for complexity assessment

### **Intelligent Triggering**
Autofill automatically activates when:
- ‚úÖ Title and description fields are empty
- ‚úÖ User has added feeds OR selected AET categories OR entered location/weather
- ‚úÖ No previous autofill is in progress
- ‚úÖ User hasn't dismissed the prompt recently

## üß† **AI Generation Logic**

### **Title Generation Strategy**
```
[Time Period] + [Primary Activity Type]

Examples:
- "Morning Show Animal Feeding & Nutrition Management"
- "Afternoon Multi-Feed Nutrition Program Implementation" 
- "Evening Health Assessment & Medical Care"
```

### **Description Generation Hierarchy**
1. **Feed-Based Activities** (Priority 1)
   - Detailed feed information with brands, amounts, costs
   - Weather impact on feeding routines
   - Animal behavior and intake monitoring
   - Educational skill connections

2. **AET Category-Based Activities** (Priority 2)
   - Focus on selected educational categories
   - Learning objective integration
   - Agricultural education standard alignment
   - Career pathway relevance

3. **Generic Activities** (Priority 3)
   - Time-appropriate livestock management
   - Weather-adapted procedures
   - General farm operations documentation
