   - Evaluate demonstration quality (observation, application, mastery)
   - Identify sub-competencies addressed

3. LEARNING QUALITY ANALYSIS:
   - Assess depth of understanding (surface, strategic, deep)
   - Evaluate practical application skills
   - Identify reflection and critical thinking indicators

4. KNOWLEDGE CONNECTIONS:
   - Connect to previous learning experiences
   - Identify prerequisite knowledge demonstrated
   - Map relationships between concepts

Create relationships between:
- Concepts learned (semantic relationships)
- Temporal sequences (what leads to what)
- Causal relationships (cause and effect)
- Competency progressions (skill building)
- Animal-specific knowledge (species connections)
- Seasonal/temporal patterns (time-based learning)

  // Content Depth (0-25 points)
  if (content.length > 200) {
    qualityScore += 15;
    factors.push('detailed_description');
  }
  if (containsTechnicalTerminology(content)) {
    qualityScore += 10;
    factors.push('technical_vocabulary');
  }
  
  // Observation Quality (0-25 points)
  if (containsSpecificMeasurements(content)) {
    qualityScore += 15;
    factors.push('quantitative_observation');
  }
  if (containsSystematicApproach(content)) {
    qualityScore += 10;
    factors.push('systematic_methodology');
  }
  
  // Critical Thinking (0-25 points)
  if (containsReflection(content)) {
    qualityScore += 15;
    factors.push('reflective_analysis');
