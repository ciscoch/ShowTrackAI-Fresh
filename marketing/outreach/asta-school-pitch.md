## üèÜ Recognizing Excellence: Building on ASTA's Championship Legacy

Dear Mr. Hawkins,

As someone who has dedicated over 20 years to agricultural education and built one of the nation's most successful programs‚Äî35 State Championships and 17 National Gold Emblems‚Äîyou understand what it takes to prepare students for agricultural careers while maintaining educational excellence.

Your background showing steers and pigs through FFA, combined with your degrees from Texas Tech and Texas A&M, positions you perfectly to evaluate how emerging technology can enhance rather than complicate agricultural education.

**We'd like to introduce ShowTrackAI‚Äîtechnology designed specifically for programs like ASTA that demand both excellence and efficiency.**
