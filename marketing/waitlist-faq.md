Yes! ShowTrackAI provides detailed documentation and evidence, but your agricultural educator maintains oversight and final approval. Our platform makes their job easier by providing comprehensive tracking and verification.

### **How does ShowTrackAI help with SAE projects?**
ShowTrackAI automatically tracks time, expenses, and activities for your Supervised Agricultural Experience (SAE) projects. Financial intelligence features help calculate profitability, while activity logging demonstrates competency developmentâ€”perfect for record books and competitions.
