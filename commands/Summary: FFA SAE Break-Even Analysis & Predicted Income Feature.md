## üèóÔ∏è Technical Implementation

### **Core Components Modified**

#### **1. Animal Model Enhancement** (`src/core/models/Animal.ts`)
```typescript
export interface Animal {
  // ... existing fields
  predictedSaleCost?: number;  // NEW: Projected sale value for market animals
  // ... other fields
}
```

**Purpose**: Enables students to set projected sale values based on market research and project goals.

#### **2. Financial Store Logic** (`src/core/stores/FinancialStore.ts`)
```typescript
interface FinancialStore {
  // ... existing methods
  getPredictedIncome: (animals?: any[]) => { 
    amount: number; 
    note: string; 
    breakdown: any[] 
  };
  getFinancialSummary: (startDate?: Date, endDate?: Date, animals?: any[]) => FinancialSummary;
}
```

**Key Features**:
- Filters only market animals (`projectType === 'Market'`)
- Calculates total predicted income from animal sale projections
- Provides species-based breakdown for educational analysis
- Includes potential profit calculations (predicted sale - acquisition cost)
- Generates educational notes about break-even analysis for SAE projects

#### **3. Financial Model Updates** (`src/core/models/Financial.ts`)
```typescript
export interface FinancialSummary {
  totalIncome: number;
  actualIncome: number;           // NEW: Actual recorded income
  predictedIncome: {              // NEW: Projected income structure
    amount: number;
    note: string;
    breakdown: Array<{
      species: string;
      count: number;
      totalValue: number;
      animals: Array<{
        name: string;
        earTag: string;
        predictedValue: number;
        acquisitionCost: number;
        potentialProfit: number;
      }>;
    }>;
  };
  // ... other fields
}
```

**Enhancement**: Separates actual vs. predicted income with detailed breakdowns for educational analysis.

#### **4. Financial Overview Display** (`src/features/financial/screens/FinancialTrackingScreen.tsx`)
```typescript
// Income breakdown display
<View style={styles.incomeBreakdown}>
  <Text style={styles.actualIncomeText}>Actual: ${summary.actualIncome.toFixed(2)}</Text>
  {summary.predictedIncome.amount > 0 && (
    <Text style={styles.predictedIncomeText}>
      Projected: ${summary.predictedIncome.amount.toFixed(2)}
    </Text>
  )}
</View>
{summary.predictedIncome.amount > 0 && (
  <Text style={styles.saeNote}>{summary.predictedIncome.note}</Text>
)}
```

**Features**:
- Shows both actual and predicted income in the main KPI card
- Displays educational note about break-even analysis for SAE projects
- Conditional display only when predicted income exists
- Color-coded text for visual distinction

#### **5. Animal Form Enhancement** (`src/features/animals/screens/AnimalFormScreen.tsx`)
```typescript
// Conditional field for market animals only
{formData.projectType === 'Market' && (
  <View style={styles.inputGroup}>
    <Text style={styles.label}>Predicted Sale Cost üìä</Text>
    <TextInput
      style={styles.input}
      value={formData.predictedSaleCost}
      onChangeText={(text) => setFormData({ ...formData, predictedSaleCost: text })}
      placeholder="0.00"
      keyboardType="numeric"
    />
    <Text style={styles.helperText}>
      üí° Used for break-even analysis and SAE financial planning
    </Text>
  </View>
)}
```

**Features**:
- Added predicted sale cost input field (only for Market project types)
- Included educational helper text explaining the feature's purpose
- Form validation and data persistence
- Contextual display based on project type

## üìö Educational Integration

### **FFA SAE Program Alignment**

**Supervised Agricultural Experience (SAE) Benefits**:
- **Financial Literacy**: Teaches students about projected vs. actual income
- **Break-Even Analysis**: Demonstrates break-even point calculations
- **Market Research**: Encourages students to research current livestock prices
- **Goal Setting**: Helps students set realistic financial targets
- **Record Keeping**: Supports FFA record book requirements

**Agricultural Education & Training (AET) Standards**:
- **ABM.01.02**: Develop and use budgets in agricultural business
- **ABM.01.03**: Maintain and evaluate financial records
- **ABM.03.01**: Develop a business plan
- **AS.02**: Animal Systems management and economics

### **Break-Even Analysis Framework**

**Core Educational Concepts**:
```
Break-Even Formula:
Break-Even Point = Total Costs (Acquisition + Variable + Fixed)
Profit = Predicted Sale Value - Total Costs
ROI = (Profit / Total Investment) √ó 100
```

**Example Market Steer Project**:
- **Purchase Price**: $800
- **Feed Costs**: $400 (6 months)
- **Other Expenses**: $225 (veterinary, show, etc.)
- **Total Costs**: $1,425
- **Predicted Sale**: $1,600
- **Expected Profit**: $175
- **Break-Even Point**: $1,425 minimum sale price

2. **Project Setup**: Selects "Market" project type
3. **Financial Planning**: Sets predicted sale cost based on market research
4. **Expense Tracking**: Records feed, veterinary, and other costs
5. **Progress Monitoring**: Views actual vs. predicted income in financial overview
6. **Break-Even Analysis**: Understands profitability and financial goals

### **Educational Display**
