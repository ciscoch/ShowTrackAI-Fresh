## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Service Layer
```typescript
// Service Factory Pattern
ServiceFactory.getAnimalService() → IAnimalService
  ↓
SupabaseAnimalAdapter (Backend) OR LocalAnimalAdapter (Local)
  ↓
Automatic user authentication and permission checking
```

### Permission Layer
```typescript
// Permission Service
AnimalPermissionsService.getAnimalPermissions(context) → AnimalPermissions
  ↓
Role-based access control with context awareness
  ↓
Granular permissions for each operation
```

### Store Layer
```typescript
// Animal Store with Auth Integration
useAnimalStore() → All animal operations with built-in auth
  ↓
Automatic permission checking and subscription enforcement
  ↓
Filtered data based on user role and relationships
```

## 📊 Permission System Details

### Student Permissions
```typescript
{
  canView: ownsAnimal,
  canEdit: ownsAnimal,
  canDelete: ownsAnimal,
  canCreate: true,
  canManageHealth: ownsAnimal,
  canViewFinancials: ownsAnimal,
  canExport: ownsAnimal,
}
```

### Educator Permissions
```typescript
{
  canView: ownsAnimal || isStudentAnimal,
  canEdit: ownsAnimal, // Cannot edit student animals
  canDelete: ownsAnimal, // Cannot delete student animals
  canCreate: true,
  canManageHealth: ownsAnimal || isStudentAnimal, // For supervision
  canViewFinancials: ownsAnimal || isStudentAnimal, // For education
  canExport: ownsAnimal || isStudentAnimal, // For reporting
}
```

### Parent Permissions
```typescript
{
  canView: ownsAnimal || isChildAnimal,
  canEdit: ownsAnimal, // Cannot edit child animals
  canDelete: ownsAnimal, // Cannot delete child animals
  canCreate: true,
