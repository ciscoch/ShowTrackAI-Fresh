### Upload Process Flow
1. **Photo Capture** → Camera/Gallery selection
2. **Local Processing** → Quality optimization and metadata
3. **Cloud Upload** → Supabase storage with progress tracking
4. **Database Update** → Health record with storage paths
5. **Analytics Tracking** → Usage metrics and educational events
6. **User Feedback** → Success/error notifications

### Enhanced Data Model
```typescript
interface HealthPhoto {
  // Existing fields...
  storagePath?: string;     // Path in Supabase storage
  uploadError?: string;     // Error message if upload failed
  uploadedAt?: Date;        // When photo was uploaded
  isUploaded?: boolean;     // Upload status flag
}
```

  photo,
  animalId,
  (progress) => console.log(`Upload: ${progress.progress}%`)
);
```

### Batch Upload with Progress
```typescript
const results = await healthPhotoUploadService.uploadMultiplePhotos(
  photos,
  animalId,
  (completed, total) => console.log(`${completed}/${total} uploaded`),
  (index, progress) => console.log(`Photo ${index}: ${progress.progress}%`)
);
```

### Secure Photo Access
```typescript
const signedUrl = await healthPhotoUploadService.getSignedUrl(
  photo.storagePath,
  3600 // 1 hour expiry
);
```
