### **Emerging Technologies**

#### **Augmented Reality Integration**
```python
class ARHealthTraining:
    def __init__(self):
        self.ar_overlays = {
            'anatomy_overlay': 'Show internal organs on live animal',
            'symptom_highlighting': 'Highlight areas of concern',
            'treatment_guidance': 'Step-by-step treatment visualization'
        }
    
    def create_ar_diagnostic_session(self, animal_type, learning_objective):
        """Create AR-enhanced diagnostic training"""
        # Generate AR overlay based on learning goals
        # Provide interactive anatomical education
        pass
```

#### **Voice-Activated Recording**
```python
class VoiceHealthRecording:
    def __init__(self):
        self.voice_commands = {
            'record_temperature': 'Record temperature [number] degrees',
            'add_symptom': 'Add symptom [symptom_name]',
            'start_observation': 'Start health check for [animal_name]',
            'emergency_alert': 'Emergency alert for [animal_name]'
        }
    
    def process_voice_command(self, audio_data):
        """Process voice commands for hands-free operation"""
        # Convert speech to text
        # Parse command and parameters
        # Execute appropriate action
        pass
```

### **Research Integration**
```python
class ResearchCollaboration:
    def __init__(self):
        self.research_partners = {}
        self.study_protocols = {}
    
    def contribute_to_research(self, student_id, research_study_id):
        """Allow students to contribute data to research studies"""
        # Ensure proper consent and anonymization
        # Contribute data to approved research studies
        # Provide feedback to students on research impact
        pass
    
    def generate_research_insights(self, dataset_id):
        """Generate insights for research community"""
        # Aggregate anonymized data
        # Generate research-quality reports
        # Share with academic partners
        pass
