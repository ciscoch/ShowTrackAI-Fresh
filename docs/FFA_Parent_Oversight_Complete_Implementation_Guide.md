// Parent provides feedback
await parentOversightService.submitParentFeedback(evidenceId, feedback);
```

**Dashboard Features:**
- Real-time progress visualization
- Evidence review with feedback system
- Parent-student communication tools
- Privacy-first data access controls

#### **🔔 Smart Notification System**
```typescript

);

// Customizable preferences
await notificationService.updateUserPreferences({
  enabled_types: ['evidence_submission', 'milestone_reached'],
  delivery_methods: ['in_app', 'push'],
  quiet_hours: { start: '22:00', end: '07:00' }
});
```

**Notification Features:**
- Multiple delivery methods (in-app, push, email, SMS)
- User preference management
- Quiet hours and frequency limits
- Template-based messaging system

#### **🛡️ Role-Based Security**
```typescript
// Check permissions
const canAccess = await userRoleService.canAccessStudentData(parentId, studentId);
const hasPermission = await userRoleService.hasPermission(userId, 'submit_evidence');

// Manage user roles
await userRoleService.createUserProfile(userId, 'student', 'Sarah Johnson');
```

**Security Features:**
- Row-level security (RLS) in database
- Granular permission system
- Verification workflows for sensitive operations
- Audit trails and access logging

### **3. Integration Points**

#### **Enhanced FFA Degree Progress Screen**
- Evidence submission buttons on each requirement
- "Share Progress" quick action for parent linking
- Real-time progress updates with parent notifications
- Seamless integration with existing degree tracking

#### **Navigation Flow**
```
FFA Dashboard → Degree Progress → Evidence Submission
                ↓
Student Linking ← → Parent Linking → Parent Dashboard
```

#### **Data Flow**
```
Student submits evidence → Updates degree progress → Notifies parents → Parent provides feedback → Student receives feedback notification
```

## 🚀 **How to Deploy**

### **1. Database Setup**
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
\i 08-parent-oversight-system.sql
\i 09-user-roles-and-notifications.sql
```

### **2. Environment Configuration**
```typescript
// Already integrated in existing environment setup
// No additional configuration required
```

### **3. Navigation Setup**
```typescript
// Already integrated in MainApp.tsx

```

### **4. Testing**
```bash
# Run integration tests
npm test ParentOversightIntegration.test.ts
```
