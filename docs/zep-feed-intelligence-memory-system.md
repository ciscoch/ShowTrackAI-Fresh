# Zep Feed Intelligence Memory System

## Overview

The Zep Feed Intelligence Memory System represents a revolutionary approach to agricultural education by combining personalized memory management with comprehensive feed analytics. This system creates a holistic knowledge graph for each student, tracking their interactions with livestock, feed decisions, and learning outcomes to provide unprecedented personalized guidance.

## Architecture

### Knowledge Graph Structure

```typescript
interface AdvancedUserKnowledgeGraph {
  entities: {
    animals: Animal[];          // Livestock with comprehensive tracking
    feedProducts: FeedProduct[]; // Detailed feed data with metadata
    performanceMetrics: PerformanceData[]; // Weight, health, growth
    photos: PhotoAnalysis[];    // AI-analyzed visual data
    skills: AETSkill[];         // Educational competencies
    vendors: VendorIntelligence[]; // Feed supplier relationships
  };
  relationships: {
    feedToWeightCorrelations: MemoryFact[]; // FCR tracking
    photoToHealthPatterns: MemoryFact[];    // Visual health indicators
    skillProgression: MemoryFact[];         // Learning advancement
    vendorPerformance: MemoryFact[];        // Supplier effectiveness
  };
}
```

### Memory Fact Structure

Memory facts capture relationships and patterns that evolve over time:

```typescript
interface MemoryFact {
  id: string;
  type: 'correlation' | 'pattern' | 'progression' | 'performance';
  subject: string;    // Entity or concept
  predicate: string;  // Relationship type
  object: string;     // Related entity or value
  confidence: number; // Confidence level (0-100)
  validAt: Date;      // When fact became valid
  invalidAt?: Date;   // When fact became invalid (optional)
  metadata: Record<string, any>; // Additional context
}
```

## Core Components

### 1. ZepMemoryService

The central service managing all memory operations:

**Key Methods:**
- `addLearningSession()` - Records educational activities
- `addFeedIntelligence()` - Stores feed-performance correlations
- `addPhotoAnalysis()` - Incorporates visual assessment data
- `getPersonalizedGuidance()` - Retrieves context-aware recommendations
- `updateKnowledgeGraph()` - Maintains relationship networks

**Learning Session Tracking:**
```typescript
interface LearningSession {
  sessionId: string;
  userId: string;
  animalId?: string;
  activity: 'feeding' | 'weighing' | 'photo_analysis' | 'journal_entry';
  duration: number;        // minutes
  outcomes: string[];      // what was accomplished
  skillsApplied: string[]; // AET skills demonstrated
  challenges: string[];    // difficulties encountered
  insights: string[];      // learning moments
  timestamp: Date;
}
```

### 2. Feed Intelligence Integration

**Feed Performance Correlation:**
The system automatically correlates feed choices with animal performance:

```typescript
// Example correlation fact
{
  subject: "Purina_Goat_Chow",
  predicate: "improves_daily_gain",
  object: "0.35_pounds_per_day",
  confidence: 85,
  validAt: "2024-01-15",
  metadata: {
    animalSpecies: "Goat",
    sampleSize: 12,
    timeframe: "30_days"
  }
}
```

**Visual-Feed Relationships:**
Photo analysis data is correlated with feeding decisions:

```typescript
// Example visual correlation
{
  subject: "body_condition_improvement",
  predicate: "correlates_with",
  object: "high_protein_feed_introduction",
  confidence: 78,
  validAt: "2024-02-01",
  metadata: {
    bodyConditionChange: +0.8,
    timeframe: "21_days",
    photoConfidence: 92
  }
}
```

### 3. Personalized Guidance Engine

The system provides contextual guidance based on accumulated knowledge:

**Mentor Response Structure:**
```typescript
interface MentorResponse {
  guidance: string;           // Primary recommendation
  recommendations: string[]; // Specific actions
  nextSteps: string[];       // Immediate tasks
  resources: string[];       // Learning materials
  confidence: number;        // System confidence (0-100)
  personalizationLevel: number; // How personalized (0-100)
}
```

**Context-Aware Recommendations:**
- Feed optimization based on historical performance
- Photo timing suggestions based on past successful documentation
- Skill development pathways tailored to demonstrated competencies
- Cost optimization recommendations based on budget patterns

## Educational Applications

### 1. Adaptive Learning Paths

The system tracks student progress and adapts learning recommendations:

**Skill Progression Tracking:**
```typescript
// Example skill progression fact
{
  subject: "student_123",
  predicate: "demonstrates_competency",
  object: "feed_conversion_analysis",
  confidence: 88,
  validAt: "2024-03-01",
  metadata: {
    aetSkillCode: "AS.03.01.02",
    proficiencyLevel: "intermediate",
    demonstrationCount: 3
  }
}
```

**Learning Style Recognition:**
- Visual learners: Emphasize photo-based learning
