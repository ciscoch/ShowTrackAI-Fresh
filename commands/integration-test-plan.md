## 📊 **Step 3: Verify Database Integration**

After creating test data, run verification:

```bash
# Quick verification
./commands/simple-verification.sh

# Detailed database check
./commands/supabase-status-check.sh
```

Expected results:
- **Profiles**: 1 (Test Student)
- **Animals**: 1 (Bessie)  
- **Journal Entries**: 1+ (feeding entries)
- **Animal Weights**: 1+ (weight records)

## 🌐 **Step 4: Manual Database Verification**

1. **Open Supabase Dashboard**: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/zifbuzsdhparxlhsifdi
2. **Go to Table Editor**
3. **Check Tables**:
   - `profiles` → Should show Test Student
   - `animals` → Should show Bessie with owner_id
   - `journal_entries` → Should show feeding entry
   - `animal_weights` → Should show weight record

## 🎯 **Success Criteria**

### ✅ **Integration Working If:**
- App loads without authentication errors
- Can create animals and they appear in database
- Can create journal entries with proper relationships
- Weight tracking saves to database
- All CRUD operations work (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
